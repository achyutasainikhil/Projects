Healthcare Data Quality & EDA Mini Project
Overview
This project focuses on data quality assessment, preprocessing, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering using a stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze stroke risk factors and improve data quality through structured data processing techniques.

Dataset
Name: Stroke Prediction Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Size: 5,110 rows Ã— 12 columns
Description: Contains demographic and health-related attributes used to predict stroke occurrence.
Project Workflow
Load Dataset: Read and display the dataset.
Data Quality Assessment:
Identify missing values
Detect duplicate rows
Check data types
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handle missing values
Convert categorical variables
Remove or transform outliers
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize distributions (Age, BMI, Glucose Levels)
Identify correlations using heatmaps
Analyze stroke trends by demographic factors
